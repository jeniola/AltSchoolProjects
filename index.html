        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>I am a graduate of computer science from ATBU, Bauchi. I did an intenship at Uplift Hub a tech hub that exposed me a litte to the world of tech. After school, I could not continue in that line as I did not have access to a laptop at the time and then i left tech completey and began hustling to afford a PC. provided access to community engagements such as the DevFest, Facebook V8 etc. I am currently in the Cloud Engineering track at Alt School
        </p>

        <h3>Why i Joined the program</h3>
        <p>I developed passion for tech fron my Sophomore year, however, I had limited access to resources and mentors. I then discovered Uplift Hubm which exposed me to the basics of tech and gave me access to a number of resources. However, I still wanted something big as I still had limited resources. Post NYSC I learnt about Alt Schoolm but I didn't have the funds at the time to commence. Subsequently, I learnt of the Scholarship program to which i applied but never got invited to sit for the Scholarship exams. This made me source for funds because I knew I had to enroll. I am grateful to have been given admission into the programme. I has not been easy as i still have to work by the side to ensure I can pay my tution fee, but overall, I am grateful </p>
